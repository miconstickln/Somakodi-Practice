      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        The Anyango's created an innovative, high quality, engaging, informal
        eating experience in a friendly neighborhood restaurant. Pizza King
        became a popular place with the teenage and college crowd. Pizza King
        attracted families that enjoyed a night out eating a meal that they
        would not be having at home. After the families left, Pizza King
        transformed itself into a hangout for college-age kids. Having a good
        time was an essential part of Pizza King.
